 * @class ComponentPlotter
 *
 * @brief This class does the work involved in Numerically Projecting the Components of a PDF
 *
 *
 * This class does all of the work and contains all of the functions required to project components from a PDF
 *
 * This requires this class examining the PDF to determine the Components in it
 *
 * Projecting each of these Components over all of the separate Discrete Combinations Present in the PhaseSpace
 *
 * This has to be able to merge the output to give the total Projection for each component onto the dataset
 *
 * This has an output which has been designed such that the total projection from multiple compatible PDFs and multiple data subsets can be merged after this class has finished.
 *
 *
 * This class can also perform a Chi2 calculation of the projection using the PDF as a truth function to the dataset.
 *
 *
 * Some of this Class will seem non obvious or even confusing, I Apologise. However this class has to be able to deal with a lot of varying parameters and keep track of what is going on
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Methodology:
 *
 *
 * This PDF first loops over all components that the PDF advertises
 *
 * For each of these components the class loops over however many many requested points in the chosen Observable space
 *
 * For each of these points it projects the PDF and renormalises the value to compare it to data
 *
 *
 * Component 0 is defined as the total value from the PDF (the PDF should return the full Evaluate here
 *
 * Discrete Combination 0 is defined as the total of each of the Discrete Combinations within the PhaseSpace
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Normalisation:
 *
 * The normalisation in this class is tricky you have to compare a PDF which returns a likelihood over the whole Observable Space which varies and never exceeds 1 or falls below 0
 *
 * The data is binned and as such the PDF has to be renormalised to give the predicted amount of data that should be in this bin from a dataset of a given size.
 *
 * This requires knowledge of the yield and such
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Chi2/N:
 *
 * The Chi2 test requires everything else to be working and has been tested on toys and code gives a correct theory curve and sensible Chi2 values
 *
 *
 * A projection is just a fancy way of saying that the PDF has been integrated over all free parameters while the Observable requested is fixed.
